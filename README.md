# File-handling-using-python
Here i am creating a simple user registation system with the hepl of python using file handling

1)If the user is new to our system, then i will ask them to signup using their email and password.
2)If the user is an existing user, then they can directly signin using their email and password.
3)Here,i am comparing user email id with the existing password,they can only signin only if the email id and password matches.suppose if the password does not match, then i am adding an option to recover their password
